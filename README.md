WikkaWiki
=========

So long, and thanks for all the fish
------------------------------------
It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing the end-of-life for WikkaWiki.  I have been an active developer with the project for 15 years, and am currently the last of the original devs.  A lot has changed in the wiki landscape (and my own life) over the years, and TBH I have not kept up with the changes in the PHP language.  In addition, it really doesn't make sense for me to continue offering new functionality for an ever-dwindling audience of WikkaWiki users.  To that end, I will maintain ownership of the github repo and related issues database, but it's doubtful there will be any more development.  Of course, in the spirit of F/OSS, anyone is free to fork the project and go off in their own direction.  

Currently, Dario (one of our early visionaries) maintains ownership of the wikkawiki.org domain; I host the various websites.  I will be shutting down the demo website, and will keep the www and docs websites alive for at least a few more months.  During that time, I will capture the content of both sites and post the SQL tarballs (purged of user data) here for posterity.  

I've truly enjoyed this journey, and I don't consider this the end, but the beginning of some new journey I've not yet realized.  To those of you who have stuck with us, thank you so much!  It makes the time spent on this project worth every second of effort put into it.
